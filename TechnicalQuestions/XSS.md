**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
They are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites


- ***Stored XSS*** generally occurs when user input is stored on the target server, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. And then a victim is able to retrieve the stored data from the web application without that data being made safe to render in the browser.

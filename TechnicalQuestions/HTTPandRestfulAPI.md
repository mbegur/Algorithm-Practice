**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**
HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the world wide web and this defines how messages are formatted and transmitted. It also defines what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.

For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web Server direction it to fetch and transmit the requested Web Page.

HTTP is a stateless protocol. This is because each command is executed independently, without knowledge of the commands that came before.
